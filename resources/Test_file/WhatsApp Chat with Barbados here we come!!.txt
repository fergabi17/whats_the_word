11/07/2020, 09:45 - Robert brother: 🙋🏾‍♂
11/07/2020, 09:49 - Billie Berti: 😏😏😏 Yesss
11/07/2020, 10:18 - Sanjeev Sbx: Barbados is more expensive than Dublin or London, so choose wisely
11/07/2020, 10:19 - Greg Fr Irl: Really? How do you know that?
11/07/2020, 10:22 - Sanjeev Sbx: Research
11/07/2020, 10:23 - Sanjeev Sbx: Heard of BigMac Index ?
11/07/2020, 10:24 - Sanjeev Sbx: Price of McDonald BigMac burger in every country gives an idea of how expensive that country is .

11/07/2020, 10:28 - Carla Silva: It looks bit like Barbados ??? Lololol
11/07/2020, 10:28 - Sanjeev Sbx: Well, I was . I have a Private Ltd. Company, I can have an “office” anywhere, that is why a lot of companies are in Bahamas, Carribeans, British Isle.... anything to pay less tax but having seen the prices and cost, Barbados is cool just for 2 weeks
11/07/2020, 10:29 - Carla Silva: Well so let’s go for 2 weeks 🤩
11/07/2020, 11:03 - Billie Berti: I know, but the rent is 41% lower... and I guess you don’t go out so much and you don’t need much to live...but maybe I am too optimistic you’re right. Especially on the ‘job’ thing, unless you hire me my god 😂
11/07/2020, 11:06 - Sanjeev Sbx: Consumer and groceries are both cheaper in UK too. Why do you think @353864403854 quit Barbados to go to UK.. Lololol
11/07/2020, 11:07 - Billie Berti: He definitely did everything just to end up in Dublin and meet us ...like we all did 🤣
